# The manuscript is currently under submission, and the complete code will be uploaded subsequently.
## We have developed an innovative deep learning model, PSECNet, for the prediction of bearing Remaining Useful Life (RUL) on the IEEE 2012 PHM Prognostic Challenge dataset.At present, only the test code has been uploaded for result verification.
The repository contains the following files:
- `best_model.pth`: The data encapsulation file of the model.
- `predict.py`: The test program.
- `IEEE 2012 PHM Prognostic Challenge dataset.7z`:The repository includes two files: `testing_dataset.txt` and `training_dataset.txt`. For convenience and accelerated reading, all CSV files of the source dataset have been converted into numpy arrays and stored as TXT format files.The files have been processed for compression.
